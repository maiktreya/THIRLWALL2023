## 1. SECTOR SYSTEM MODELS

***
***

- 3SLS with distinct methods.
- Including dummies or not.
- Drop lagged dependant (ONLY IMPORTS):
  - Implies a DL form and associated problems (autocorrelation, cointegration factor).
  - But also certain advantages (more accurate forecasts while still distingisuing between LR and SR)
  - As a model, imports become redundant for FGLS, then 2SLS=3SLS, SUR=OLS

***

## 2. COUNTRY SYSTEM MODEL

***
***

- Last attempt because in principle it does not converge in each sector.
- Remaining strategies to try:
  - Drop dummies
  - Try 3SLS dinstinct methods using consump as instrument.

## 3. Is there any strategy pending to apply?
>
> Try all the previous model with imports as just SUR. DONE
> Once a  final candidate has been choosen, compare its results to a simple OLS regression in diffs. DONE
> Just choose the best model. DONE
> Remaining: test agains sectoral models without iterate.

## 4. BOUNDS F TEST CHECK OF ENOUGH EVIDENCE OF COINTEGRATION
> Need to check
